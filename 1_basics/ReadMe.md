# Hook.io - The Basics
  Three tutorials describing the methods of accessing the hook.io cloud (using vanilla hooks and the hook.io repl), connecting to your hooks, and the hook.io events basics.

## Part 1 - Using Hooks
This tutorial differentiates between the client and server roles of vanilla hooks and the hook.io repl, a full-featured repl with autocomplete.

## Part 2 - Hook Discovery
In this video, hook.io's automatic hook discovery is explained - a hook.io feature that automagically configures the hook's role on the network when `hook.start()` is called.  Additionally, two other methods of initiating a hook connection - `hook.listen()` and `hook.connect()` - are detailed.

## Part 3 - Hook Events
In the final Hook.io Basics tutorial, hook.io events are taught.  The two hook.io methods for working with events, `hook.emit()` (for emitting events to hooks) and `hook.on()` (for listening to specific hook events) are shown here.
